## Build, train, and deploy ML models with Amazon SageMaker, AWS EMEA Online Summit 2021

[**Boston Housing Notebook**](boston_housing.ipynb) used for the **Build, train, and deploy ML models** talk at AWS EMEA Online Summit 2021.


## Prerequisites

### AWS Account

This workshop has been designed assuming that each participant is using an AWS account that has been provided and pre-configured by the workshop instructor(s). However, you can also choose to use your own AWS account, but you'll have to execute some preliminary configuration steps as described below.

**Permissions**: In order to complete this workshop you'll need an AWS Account, and an AWS IAM user in that account with at least full permissions to the following AWS services: 

- AWS IAM
- Amazon S3
- Amazon SageMaker
- AWS CloudShell or AWS Cloud9
- Amazon EC2:  including P3, C5, and M5 instance types; to check your limits, see [Viewing Your Current Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-resource-limits.html).  If you do not have at least the default limits specified in [the Amazon SageMaker Limits table](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sagemaker.html), please file a limit increase request via the AWS console.

**Use Your Own Account**: The code and instructions in this workshop assume only one student is using a given AWS account at a time. If you try sharing an account with another student, you'll run into naming conflicts for certain resources. You can work around these by appending a unique suffix to the resources that fail to create due to conflicts, but the instructions do not provide details on the changes required to make this work. Use a personal account or create a new AWS account for this workshop rather than using an organizationâ€™s account to ensure you have full access to the necessary services and to ensure you do not leave behind any resources from the workshop.

**Costs**: Some, but NOT all, of the resources you will launch as part of this workshop are eligible for the AWS free tier if your account is less than 12 months old. See the [AWS Free Tier page](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) for more details. An example of a resource that is **not** covered by the free tier is the Amazon SageMaker instance types used in some workshops. To avoid charges for endpoints and other resources you might not need after you've finished a workshop, do not forget to terminate the resources. 


### AWS Region

Amazon SageMaker is not available in all AWS Regions at this time.  Accordingly, we recommend running this workshop in one of the following supported AWS Regions:  N. Virginia, Oregon, Ohio, Ireland or Sydney.

Once you've chosen a region, you should create all of the resources for this workshop there, including a new Amazon S3 bucket and a new SageMaker notebook instance. Make sure you select your region from the dropdown in the upper right corner of the AWS Console before getting started.
