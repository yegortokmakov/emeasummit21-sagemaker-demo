Automatic Model Tuning in SageMaker is used to tune the model's hyperparameters. If you are using TensorFlow 2, you can use the Amazon SageMaker prebuilt TensorFlow 2 framework container with training scripts similar to those you would use outside SageMaker.\n",

This public dataset contains 13 features regarding housing stock of towns in the Boston area.  Features include average number of rooms, accessibility to radial highways, adjacency to a major river, etc.  \n",

We'll also set up a SageMaker Session to perform various operations, and specify an Amazon S3 bucket to hold input data and output.

In a typical SageMaker workflow, notebooks are only used for prototyping and can be run on relatively inexpensive and less powerful instances, while processing, training and model hosting tasks are run on separate, more powerful SageMaker-managed instances.  SageMaker Processing includes off-the-shelf support for Scikit-learn, as well as a Bring Your Own Container option, so it can be used with many different data transformation technologies and tasks.
