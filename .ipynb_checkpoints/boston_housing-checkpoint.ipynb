    "# Boston Housing - Price Prediction with Amazon SageMaker\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will predict house prices based on the well-known Boston Housing dataset with a simple regression model in Tensorflow 2. This public dataset contains 13 features regarding housing stock of towns in the Boston area. Features include average number of rooms, accessibility to radial highways, adjacency to a major river, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook includes all key steps such as preprocessing data with SageMaker Processing, and model training and deployment with SageMaker hosted training and inference. Automatic Model Tuning in SageMaker is used to tune the model's hyperparameters. If you are using TensorFlow 2, you can use the Amazon SageMaker prebuilt TensorFlow 2 framework container with training scripts similar to those you would use outside SageMaker.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, we'll import some necessary packages and set up directories for training and test data. We'll also set up a SageMaker Session to perform various operations, and specify an Amazon S3 bucket to hold input data and output. The default bucket used here is created by SageMaker if it doesn't already exist, and named in accordance with the AWS account ID and AWS Region."

    "## Data preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll import the dataset and transform it with SageMaker Processing, which can be used to process terabytes of data in a SageMaker-managed cluster separate from the instance running your notebook server. In a typical SageMaker workflow, notebooks are only used for prototyping and can be run on relatively inexpensive and less powerful instances, while processing, training and model hosting tasks are run on separate, more powerful SageMaker-managed instances.  SageMaker Processing includes off-the-shelf support for Scikit-learn, as well as a Bring Your Own Container option, so it can be used with many different data transformation technologies and tasks.  An alternative to SageMaker Processing is [SageMaker Data Wrangler](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/data-wrangler/), a visual data preparation tool integrated with the SageMaker Studio UI.    \n",
    "\n",
    "To work with SageMaker Processing, first we'll load the Boston Housing dataset, save the raw feature data and upload it to Amazon S3 so it can be accessed by SageMaker Processing.  We'll also save the labels for training and testing."

    "So far we have simply run one Hosted Training job without any real attempt to tune hyperparameters to produce a better model.  Selecting the right hyperparameter values to train your model can be difficult, and typically is very time consuming if done manually. The right combination of hyperparameters is dependent on your data and algorithm; some algorithms have many different hyperparameters that can be tweaked; some are very sensitive to the hyperparameter values selected; and most have a non-linear relationship between model fit and hyperparameter values.  SageMaker Automatic Model Tuning helps automate the hyperparameter tuning process:  it runs multiple training jobs with different hyperparameter combinations to find the set with the best model performance.\n",
